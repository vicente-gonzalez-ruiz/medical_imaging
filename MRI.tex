\section{Clinical applications}
\begin{itemize}
\item \gls{MRI}
  \cite{westbrook2018mri,Wu2022MRI_Physics,thePIRL2018NMR_basics,thePIRL2018SpinEcho,thePIRL2018Fourier,thePIRL2018GRE}
  allows to obtain detailed views of (usually living) samples
  (tissues, organs, and even a complete organism) without irradiate
  them \cite{wikipedia_MRI}.
\end{itemize}

\section{MRI axes}
\begin{itemize}
\item A patient is placed in the bore of the MRI machine to be
  subjected to $B_0$, a \popup{very strong magnetic field}{In the
    order of Teslas (T). 1 Tesla = 10,000 gauss and the Earth’s
    magnetic field is approx. 0.5 gauss.}, parallel to the $Z$-axis.
\end{itemize}

  \label{fig:MRI_axes}
\end{figure}

\section{The magnet responsible for $B_0$}
\begin{itemize}
\item $B_0$ is a permanent magnetic field generated by \popup{toroidal
    magnet}{A superconducting electromagnet refigerated with liquid
    helium at -269°C, that can weight several tons.}. A section is
  show in Fig.~\ref{fig:MRI_machine_scheme}.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-4ex}
\begin{figure}[!b]

  \caption{A schematic section of the MRI machine \cite{abdulla2025MRI_machine}.}
  \label{fig:MRI_machine_scheme}
\end{figure}

\section{Gradient coils}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are three sets of coils orientated in the $X$, $Y$ and $Z$
  axes, used to generate a gradient in $B_0$ (see
  Section~\ref{sec:spatial_encoding}).
\item Gradient coils generate a constant variation (gradient) $B_1$ to
  $B_0$ along the $Z$-axis, generating $B_0+B_1$.
\end{itemize}

\section{\glsentrylong{RF} (\glsentryshort{RF}) (body) coil ... and others}
\begin{itemize}
\item In Fig.~\ref{fig:MRI_machine_scheme} the ``body''-coil is shown,
  which is used to image large parts of the patient.
\item This coil transmits and receives \gls{EM} signals.
\item There are other specialized coils (not shown in the figure),
  such as:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Head coil} (transmit and receive): incorporated into a
    helmet and used for head scans.
  \item \textbf{Surface} (or local) \textbf{coils} (receive only):
    these are small coils applied \popup{as close to the area being
      imaged as possible}{To increase the SNR.} e.g. arm, leg,
    orbits, lumbar spine coils etc.
  \item \textbf{Arrays of coils} that only transmit or receive, and that are
    then combined to improve the SNR.
  \end{enumerate}
\item The RF \cite{wikipedia_RF} coils are \popup{switched on and off
    rapidly}{Forming train of impulses of time-variying period.}, with
  a period of 1 ms or less, and it is this that creates the loud
  noise.
\item The smaller the distance between the coils and the patient, the
  better the strength of the signals, and the higher the \gls{SNR}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hydrogen nuclei can be considered tiny magnets}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hydrogen nuclei act like tiny \popup{magnets}{A hydrogen nucleus
    contains a single proton so it has a charge of +1. The nucleus
    also has an intrinsic “spin”. Because they have a charge and
    motion they create an electric current and this, in turn, creates
    a magnetic field.} and will be affected by any magnetic field
  applied to them.
\item Hydrogen nuclei are \popup{the most useful atoms}{Any nucleus
    with an odd number of protons can be used (an unpaired proton is
    needed to provide the magnetic moment due to the spin of the
    unpaired proton).} to use in \gls{MRI} mainly because they form the
  majority of atoms in the body.
\item Most will adopt the low energy state (the direction of $B_0$)
  but a few in the opposite direction (the high energy state),
  creating a net longitudinal magnetization (M$_Z$) in the $Z$-axis
  direction.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-4ex}
\begin{figure}[!b]

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{mri-intro-netmag}
  \caption{Net magnetization under the influence of $B_0$ \cite{abdulla2025MRI_intro}.}
  \label{fig:MRI-intro-netmag}
\end{figure}

\section{Precession}
\begin{itemize}
\item Under the influence of $B_0+B_1$, the hydrogen nuclei precess in the Z-axis.
\item The precession has a characteristic \popup{resonant}{``Larmor''.}
  frequency for each \popup{atom and $B_0+B_1$ intensity}{42 MHz a 1 Tesla
    in the case of hydrogen}.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-4ex}
\begin{figure}[!b]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{mri-intro-precession}
  \caption{Nuclei precession \cite{abdulla2025MRI_intro}.}
  \label{fig:MRI-intro-precession}
\end{figure}

\section{Resonance magnetization}
\begin{itemize}
\item When all the nuclei are precessing, an orthogonal to $B_0+B_1$
  ($Z$-axis) time-varying magnetization oscillating at the resonance
  frequency is applied from the RF coil, making the nuclei to resonate
  in the $XY$ plane.
\end{itemize}

\section{Relaxation $T_1$ and $T_2$ times}
\begin{itemize}
\item As soon as $B_1$ is switched off, the transverse magnetization
  begins to disappear and the nuclei relax back to their resting state
  of net longitudinal magnetization. 
\item \popup{$T_1$}{Also known as spin-lattice and longitudinal
    relaxation time because T_1 depends on the surrounding molecules
    and lattice.} is the time it takes for M$_Z$ (longitudinal
  magnetization) to recover to 63\% of its equilibrium state after
  being perturbed by the $B_1$ pulse.
\item \popup{$T_2$}{Also known as spin-spin relaxation time.} is
  defined as the time required for the M$_{XY}$ (transverse magnetization) to
  decay to 37\% of its peak level after the $B_1$ pulse.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Relaxation times depends on the tissue and the strength of
  $B_0$. Some examples (for 1 Tesla) are show in the Table \ref{tab:relaxation_times}:
  \begin{table}
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{r|rr}
        Tissue & $T_1$ (ms) & $T_2$ (ms) \\
        \hline
        Fat & 250 & 80 \\
        Kidney & 550 &  60 \\
        White matter & 650 & 90 \\
        Grey matter & 800 & 100 \\
        CSF & 2000 & 150 \\
        Water & 3000 & 3000 \\
        Bone, teeth & Very long & Very short
      \end{tabular}
      \caption{Typical relaxation times for different tissues
        \cite{abdulla2025MRI_T1T2}.}
      \label{tab:relaxation_times}
    \end{center}
  \end{table}
\item $T_1$ is always longer than $T_2$ except in pure water in which
  $T_1=T_2$.
\end{itemize}

\section{$T_1$-weighted imaging}
\begin{itemize}
\item The contrast of the images depends on $T_1$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-3ex}
\begin{figure}[!b]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{mri-t1-brain}
  \caption{MRI slice of the brain using $T_1$-weighting \cite{abdulla2025MRI_weighting}.}
  \label{fig:MRI-T1-weighting}
\end{figure}

\section{$T_2$-weighted imaging}
\begin{itemize}
\item The contrast of the images depends on $T_2$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-3ex}
\begin{figure}[!b]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{mri-t2-brain}
  \caption{MRI slice of the brain using $T_2$-weighting \cite{abdulla2025MRI_weighting}.}
  \label{fig:MRI-T2-weighting}
\end{figure}

\section{PD-weighted imaging}
\begin{itemize}
\item The contrast of the images depends on the density of hydrogen
  protons. PD = Proton Density.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-3ex}
\begin{figure}[!b]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{mri-pd-brain}
  \caption{MRI slice of the brain using PD-weighting \cite{abdulla2025MRI_weighting}.}
  \label{fig:MRI-PD-weighting}
\end{figure}

\section{Spatial encoding}
\label{sec:spatial_encoding}
\begin{itemize}
\item Remember: The hydrogen nuclei resonate at a
  \popup{frequency}{Larmor frequency.} that depends on the strength of
  the magnetic field, $B_0+B_1$, which is a \popup{\gls{RF}
    signal}{$B_0$ is constant but $B_1$ is a time-variying
    signal. Obviously, the sum is also variable over time.}.
\item Therefore, by modifying $B_0+B_1$ in: (1) amplitude, (2)
  frequency, and (3) phase, we can know the resonating frequency (and
  phase) of a \popup{3D section}{A cuve of tissue.} of the patient.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-4ex}
\begin{figure}[!b]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=4.0cm]{mri-spatial-localisation}
  \caption{Spatial ``encoding'' \cite{abdulla2025MRI_encoding}.}
  \label{fig:MRI-encoding}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Therefore, using \popup{phase-sensitive band-pass filters}{Also
    called complex filters.}, we can determine the amplitude of the
  signal generated by each 3D section (also known as \gls{FOV}).
\item This information is, by definition, a \popup{matrix of coefficient in the
    Fourier domain}{Fourier coefficients are complex numbers, with
    amplitude and plase, or alternatively, real and imaginary
    parts.}.
\item Such information is received by the RF coils that, apart from
  generate the gradients in the $XY$-plane, act as a RF antenna.
\end{itemize}

\section{The K-space}
\begin{itemize}
\item In its \popup{simplest version}{The K-space can be also a 3D
    tensor, and the reconstruction can be found using the 3D inverse
    Fourier transform.}, the K-space is a 2D matrix where the
  amplitude and phase of each 3D section of a slice is stored.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-4ex}
\begin{figure}[!b]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=5.5cm]{mri-kspacewavesignal}
  \caption{The K-space and some single-coefficient inverse transformations \cite{abdulla2025MRI_Kspace}.}
  \label{fig:MRI-Kspace}
\end{figure}

\section{3D reconstruction}
\begin{itemize}
\item To reconstruct a slice, we need to compute the 2D inverse
  Fourier transform of the content of the corresponding K-space.
\item To obtain the final 3D reconstruction, all the reconstructed
  (2D) slices are stacked.
\item Notice that in MRI, the tomograms are in the Fourier domain.
\end{itemize}

\section{Image quality in \acrshort{MRI}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \gls{SNR}: In the case of MRI, it depends on the \popup{strength
    of the signal received by the antenna}{Precession of coherent
    magnetization.}, and the \popup{strength of noise signal}{Random
    frequencies existing in space and time, primarily from thermal
    motion of the molecules (in the patient) and background electrical
    noise of the electronics}.
\item The \textbf{\gls{SNR}} increases with the \popup{strength of
    B0}{As the magnetic field strength increases, the Net Magnetic
    Vector (NMV) increases, leading to more available magnetization
    and consequently higher SNR. Doubling the field strength
    approximately doubles the SNR.} \cite{westbrook2018mri}, the
  \popup{proton density}{Areas with a high concentration of MR-active
    protons (e.g., the pelvis) yield higher signal and thus higher
    SNR, whereas areas with low proton density (e.g., the lungs)
    result in lower signal and SNR.} \cite{westbrook2018mri}, the
  \popup{coil(s) efficiency and distance to the sample}{Basically, the
    SNR is proportional to the inverse of the diameter of the
    tube. The power of the excitation RF signals is also proportional
    to the SNR.}, the \popup{\emph{signal scanning times}}{Longer TR
    (Time-Repetition) allows for greater longitudinal magnetization
    recovery, making more signal available for conversion to
    transverse magnetization, which typically improves SNR. Shorter TE
    (Time-Echo) allows less coherent transverse magnetization to decay
    before the echo is collected, resulting in higher SNR.}
  \cite{westbrook2018mri}, the \popup{Number of Signal Averages
    (NSA)}{Increasing the NSA directly increases SNR, as correctly
    encoded signal is reinforced while random noise averages out.}
  \cite{westbrook2018mri}, the \popup{size of the voxels}{Larger
    voxels contain more spins, which contribute to a higher signal and
    consequently increased SNR.}  \cite{westbrook2018mri}, and depends
  on the reconstruction algorithms \cite{bushberg2011essential}.
\item \textbf{Spatial resolution}: Depends fundamentally on the \emph{minimal
    slice-thickness} provided by the internal coils, the
  resolution of the k-space, and on the magnetic field
    strength ($B_0$) to provide a high enough \popup{SNR per voxel}{The SNR
    increases with $B_0$ and the voxel size, so, to increase the
    resolution (decrease the voxel size) we must keep high enough the
    SNR by increasing $B_0$. Otherwise, the noise can make it difficult
    to recognize the pathology}.
\item \textbf{Contrast}: Image contrast refers to the differences in
  signal intensity between various anatomical features, between
  anatomy and pathology, or between different tissues
  \cite{westbrook2018mri}. Contrast can be increased if we use
  \popup{\emph{image weighting}}{For example, T2-weighted volumes
    usually enhances pathologies.}, \popup{\emph{contrast
      agents}}{E.g., gadolinium can selectively shorten relaxation
    times, increasing the contrast between pathology and normal
    anatomy-}, among \popup{\emph{other MRI contrast-enhancing
      techniques}}{Magnetization transfer contrast, phase-contrast MR
    angiography, or the use of presaturation pulses}
  \cite{westbrook2018mri}.
