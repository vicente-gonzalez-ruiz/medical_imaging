\chapter{Image and Video Compression}

The crucial topic of image compression, distinguishing between
reversible (lossless) and irreversible (lossy) methods, is discussed,
noting the controversy around irreversible compression for diagnostic
images due to information loss versus potential noise reduction
\cite{bushberg2011essential}.
