\chapter{Interpolation (super-resolution)}

\section{Nearest-neighbor}

Simple, but can cause blocky artifacts.

\section{Linear / bilinear / trilinear}

Smooth transitions, commonly used in CT/MRI resampling.

\section{Spline / cubic convolution}

Better for preserving edges and fine details.

\section{Kriging or advanced methods}

Occasionally used for high-precision imaging research.}

\section{AI-based super-resolution}
