\chapter{Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine}

DICOM is a technical standard for the digital storage and transmission
of medical images and related information.[1] It includes a file
format definition, which specifies the structure of a DICOM file, as
well as a network communication protocol that uses TCP/IP to
communicate between systems \cite{wikipedia2025DICOM}.

Strategies for image storage (hierarchical, prefetching, on-demand)
are covered \cite{bushberg2011essential}.
