\chapter{\glsentrylong{DICOM}}

DICOM is a technical standard for the digital storage and transmission
of medical images and related information.[1] It includes a file
format definition, which specifies the structure of a DICOM file, as
well as a network communication protocol that uses TCP/IP to
communicate between systems \cite{wikipedia2025DICOM}.

allowing devices and systems from different manufacturers to communicate and share medical image data seamlessly.

combines the image data with a wealth of metadata (name, ID, age, the type of imaging modality used (e.g., MRI, CT, X-ray), and acquisition parameters)

Strategies for image storage (hierarchical, prefetching, on-demand)
are covered \cite{bushberg2011essential}.

Standardisation of Display: The DICOM Grayscale Standard Display Function (GSDF) is highlighted as a critical standard for ensuring predictable transformation of pixel values to luminance and similar contrast display across devices, aiming for perceptual linearization \cite{bushberg2011essential}.

DICOM ULP

UPL (Upper Layer Protocol) operates on a client-server model, where devices, known as Application Entities (AEs), communicate with each other. The protocol defines a set of Protocol Data Units (PDUs), which are the messages exchanged during these steps:

    Association Establishment (A-ASSOCIATE-RQ/AC/RJ PDU): Before any data is sent, two AEs must establish an "association." This is like a handshake where they negotiate and agree on the types of information and services they will exchange. This includes details like image compression, transfer syntax (byte ordering), and the specific DICOM services they will use (e.g., C-STORE for storing an image).

Data Transfer (P-DATA-TF PDU): Once the association is established, the actual DICOM messages, containing both command sets and image data, are transferred using this PDU. This is where the bulk of the medical image and patient data is transmitted.

Association Termination (A-RELEASE-RQ/RP/ABORT PDU): After the data transfer is complete, the association is properly released. This ensures an orderly end to the communication session. An "abort" PDU is used to terminate a session abruptly in case of an error.

The DICOM ULP essentially provides a "language" for medical devices to negotiate, send, and receive data, abstracting away the complexities of the underlying network and ensuring that different vendors' equipment can communicate effectively.
