% Medical Image Acquisition

With the exception of nuclear medicine\footnote{In nuclear medicine
  imaging, radioactive substances are injected or ingested, and it is
  the physiological interactions of the agent that give rise to the
  information in the images \cite{bushberg2011essential}.}, all
medical imaging techniques require that the energy used to penetrate
the body’s tissues also interacts with those tissues.\footnote{If
  energy were to pass through the body and not experience some type of
  interaction (e.g., absorption or scattering), then the detected
  energy would not contain any useful information regarding the
  internal anatomy, and thus it would not be possible to construct an
  image of the anatomy using that information
  \cite{bushberg2011essential}.}

The power, energy and time required to acquiring medical images
require a compromise between patient safety and image
quality.\footnote{Better x-ray images can be made when the radiation
  dose to the patient is high, better magnetic resonance images can be
  made when the image acquisition time is long, and better ultrasound
  images result when the ultrasound power levels are large
  \cite{bushberg2011essential}.}
