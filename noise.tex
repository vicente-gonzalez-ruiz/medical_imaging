\chapter{Noise}

Includes quantum mottle (statistical nature of photon detection),
grain noise (in film radiography), structured noise (due to detector
electronics or artefacts like splashes on intensifiers), and
anatomical noise (superimposition of unrelated anatomical structures)
\cite{bushberg2011essential}.


Noise Power Spectrum (NPS): A frequency-dependent measure that
describes the overall noise level and noise texture (how noise is
correlated between pixels). It's crucial for imaging system design and
comprehensive evaluation \cite{bushberg2011essential}.

High noise levels degrade contrast resolution and object conspicuity,
making lesions harder to detect. Image processing techniques like
smoothing can reduce noise but may compromise spatial
resolution. \cite{bushberg2011essential}.
