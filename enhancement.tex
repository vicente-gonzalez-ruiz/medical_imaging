ç\chapter{Medical Image Enhancement}

The primary objective of medical image enhancement is to improve the visual quality of an image, enabling physicians to more accurately observe and interpret critical details. Enhancements such as brightness adjustment, contrast optimization, edge sharpening, and other visual refinements can significantly aid in this process. For example, in modalities like X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds, enhancement techniques can improve the visibility of tumors, blood vessels, bones, and other anatomical structures.
