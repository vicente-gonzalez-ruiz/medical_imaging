\chapter{Mammography}

Mammography is radiography of the breast, and is thus a transmission
projection type of imaging. To accentuate contrast in the breast,
mammography makes use of much lower x-ray energies than general
purpose radiography, and consequently the x-ray and detector systems
are designed specifically for breast imaging
\cite{bushberg2011essential}.

\section{Image quality}

Radiography and Mammography: The transition to digital radiography
(CR, flat panel) and associated image processing algorithms for
contrast normalisation and display (e.g., exposure index,
LUTs). Dual-energy subtraction to reduce anatomical noise. In digital
mammography, specific nonlinear post-processing algorithms are used to
equalise contrast across the image, creating "For Presentation"
images. Tomosynthesis is presented as a method using multiple low-dose
angular views to reconstruct tomographic images for improved lesion
detection.
