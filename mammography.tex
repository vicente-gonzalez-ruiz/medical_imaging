\chapter{Mammography}

Mammography is radiography of the breast, and is thus a transmission
projection type of imaging. To accentuate contrast in the breast,
mammography makes use of much lower x-ray energies than general
purpose radiography, and consequently the x-ray and detector systems
are designed specifically for breast imaging
\cite{bushberg2011essential}.
