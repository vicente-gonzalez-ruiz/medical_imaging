\chapter{Segmentation}

% 3D surface reconstruction (ultrasound)

Thresholding: Based on intensity (simple, but ultrasound intensities can vary a lot).

Region Growing: Start from seed points inside the face region and expand.

Machine Learning / Deep Learning: Modern approaches use CNNs or U-Nets to segment anatomical structures directly in 3D.

Identifying specific regions such as tumors, organs, or vessels.

Can be done via thresholding, region growing, watershed, or deep learningâ€“based methods (e.g., U-Net).
