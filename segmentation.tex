% 3D surface reconstruction (ultrasound)

Thresholding: Based on intensity (simple, but ultrasound intensities can vary a lot).

Region Growing: Start from seed points inside the face region and expand.

Machine Learning / Deep Learning: Modern approaches use CNNs or U-Nets to segment anatomical structures directly in 3D.
