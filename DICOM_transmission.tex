\chapter{\gls{DICOM} data transmission}

\section{Transmission using the \gls{ULP}}
\begin{itemize}
\item A pair of \gls{DICOM} devices communicate using a client-server
  model based on the \popup{DICOM \gls{ULP}}{An application-layer
    protocol.} which runs on top of standard TCP/IP.
\item Steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Association establishment (handshake)}: the
    application entities agree about the \popup{task to be
      performed}{For example, sending an image.}, and the
    \popup{transfer syntax}{The compression method (e.g., JPEG, RLE)
      and byte order that will be used for the data.}.
  \item \textbf{Data Exchange (conversation)}: The sender sends the
    image using a C-STORE-RQ (Request) message (which the DICOM image,
    including the DICOM header) and, if the message has been
    successfully, the receiver send a C-STORE-RSP (Response).
  \item \textbf{Association Release (Hanging Up)}: After all data has
    been successfully sent and acknowledged, the devices terminate the
    association.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
